** Blade Mistress **
by Thom Robertson

Thank you for playing Blade Mistress!

Blade Mistress is a server-centric, ultra-low bandwidth, persistant world,
massively multiplayer, 3D graphical fantasy role-playing game.

What does ultra-low bandwidth mean?  It means that bandwidth
costs big bucks, so the only way to bring this game to you is
to design the game from the ground up with a commitment to using
as little network bandwidth as possible.  The result is a game
map that is divided into large squares, and you move from
square to square, instead of just going anywhere you want.

Changes:
	Pet dragons are in the game!
	Fixed bug that would make you not auto-attack monsters.
	Allowed dragons back on the surface.
	Dokk now drops 3 Vizorium ingots.  His centurions each drop 1.
	Monsters now sometimes drop meat.  Pets eat meat.

9/24/02
Further changes:
	Fixed bug that wouldn't let you drop ingredients, like powders.
	Added some color-coding to the item lists.
	Added additional UI helper stuff, like flashing-on-hover over, and squares you
		can go to highlighted.

9/24/02
Changes:
	Added powders, monster dropped items which can be used in swordcrafting to give
		extra abilities to the sword.  Now, currently the monsters will drop the powders
		VERY rarely, and won't drop the powders at all UNLESS the monster's to-hit value
		is more than your dodge skill.  So, more experienced players can't kill just anything
		to get powder.
	Increased totem cost by about 50%, and reduced totem lifespan by about 10%.
	Changed dodge XP rules, so you can no longer get dodge XP from monsters that have a
		lower to-hit value than your dodge level, BUT you can get dodge XP from monsters that
		have up to 10 more to-hit than your dodge, AND the dodge XP you get is the difference
		between the monsters' to-hit and your dodge level.
	Totems now disintegrate after too many imbues.  The higher quality totems take more
		imbues before they shatter, but no totem can take more than 30 imbues.
	You can adjust the camera up and down now, with the 8 and 2 keypad keys, and the right-
		button-hold of the mouse.  Pressing the keypad 5 resets the camera back the way it was.
	Hot-keys are changed and added.  Specifically, the Wield list has been renamed Used.
		the Hotkey is 'u'.  Alternatively, the Ins, Hme, PgUp, and PgDn keys now
		are hotkeys for Inventory, Used, Workbench, and Skills, respectively.
	Grouchy monsters (like spirits) now think twice about moving too far away from their
		spawn point.

9/21/02
Changes:
	Minor server tweaks.
	Changed initial inventory for new avatars.
	Changed damage bar art.
	Tried to reduce the merry-go-round problem with avatars not standing still.
	Added /friend and /ignore lists to the game.
		To ignore Bear, type 
			/ignore bear
		To un-ignore him, type the same thing again.
		To see your friends list, type
			/friend list or just /f
		To add Bear to your friends list, type
			/friend add Bear
		To remove him from the list, type
			/friend remove Bear
		To tell something special to your friends, type
			/friend Something special.
		Remember, you can abbreviate /friend as /f in all these cases.

9/19/02
Changes:
	further changes to the Realm of Spirits adventure.
	Added Words of Power.
	changed the totem distibution, adding 4 new totem qualities at the top end, each
	very expensive.
	Added a new totem magic type, Protection from Spirits.

9/18/02
The Realm of Spirits has begun to stir...

Changes:
	Changed the way text is handled internally.  The only outwardly visible sign is
	small changes to some of the text.
	Added a screen to explicitly tell the player if the game cannot contact the server.
	Small bug fixes, including straigtning out the werewolf run graphic glitch.
	Changed the /who command to be a bit more informative.
	Now when a player first enters the world, everyone gets a message about it.
	Changes to herald the opening of the Realm of Spirits.

9/16/02
Changes:
	The big change is a 4th inventory button, for wielded items.  Now you place items
	in the Wield list in order to wield them.  This means:

		Place a sword in the wielded list to ready it for use.  If there's more than one
		sword in the list, the top-most one is the one that gets used.

		Place a totem in the wielded list to use its effects.  Any number of totems can
		be put in the wielded list, but only the most powerful of each type will effect
		you.  The lifespan of each totem will not be effected, no matter where you
		carry it.

		Anything can be placed in the wielded list without problems.  Only blades and
		totems will actually DO anything when wielded.

	Also fixed a couple of small problems, and began assembling the Realm of Spirits.

9/14/02
Changes:
	Changes to the loot for low end monsters, ensuring that no piece of loot is ever worth
	less than 2, and even low level monsters drop at least 2 items, and usually more.

	Fixed a couple of exploits, one about making characters with extreme stats, and the other
	about getting free hits in combat while crafting.  Be warned, if you have a character
	with illegal stats, the next time you log in, that character will be reset to 4/4/4.

	Fixed bug that kept people from making new characters.

	Began implementing the Realm of Spirits.


9/12/02
Changes:
	Sounds are in.
	Loot drop has changed; the individual loot items have been halved in value, but
	the monsters (especially the tougher monsters) now drop more loot.
	Your re-spawn town is now correctly set when you teleport.
	The Great Trees are in the game.  In the coming months, they will be the starting
	point for quests and other cool things.
9/10/02
Changes:
	Admins can now kick players off.
	Players that don't do anything for 20 minutes are now automatically logged out.
	the new /about command will tell you the username and lifetime of any player 
	who's logged on.  The lifetime is now logged with the character file.
	For certain players, there's a button on the character selection screen that changes
	to a very simple, low-res avatar texture system.
	Big swords (more than 64 ingots) are now much harder to make.  Also, you may not
	use more than 64 ingots of a certain type to make a sword.
	Merchant inventories regenerate over time.  This time span has increased for
	merchants with nicer totems.
	Include and Exclude now come in 5 and 20 options.
	Monsters have been re-distributed, to be more in line with expectations.
	The F12 key no longer shuts down the client.
	

9/09/02
Changes:
	Treasure chest loot is worth 5 times more now.
	Dungeons will keep a mistress for 2 weeks, now.
	Several new particle effects have been added.
	The Belt of Tribal Avatar has been added to the game.

9/07/02
Small changes:
	Fixed a problem with static monsters clustering at the entrance to a dungeon.
	Also fixed a crash bug caused by players choosing the Trade option on cave entrances.
	A couple of other small fixes, too.
	Thank you for playing!

9/05/02
And hey presto!  Treasure chests are in!  Thanks for Andrei for the spiffy chest.
They work as detailed below, with ONE big addition.  The treasure chests only spawn
good loot if there is a mistress.  How do you know if there's a mistress?  There will
be a particle effect at the entrance to the cave mouth.  If the cave mouth is empty
and dull, there's no one home, and no good loot to be had.


9/04/02
Treasure chests are coming to the dungeons.  The idea is that
each dungeon has 3 treasure chests, that generate loot, and re-spawn the
loot every 3 hours.  Now, while the treasure chest has loot in it, AND
there's a player in the dungeon who's NOT the mistress, AND the mistress is
logged on, the mistress will get money every 10 minutes.  Hopefully this will
encourage mistresses to make fun dungeons that protect the treasure chests.

Treasure chests will (hopefully) be in the game in the next update.

Changes:
    Town Mages, a new red NPC which heals you, and teleports you to another
town, for money.
        The town mage heals for 100g a pop.  The amount healed is 50 -
(dodgeSkill * 3), but never less than 3.  This means that players with high
physical and high dodge skill pay much more for sufficient healing than
non-combat players.
        The town mages all exist in a 12-town chain.  The town mage will
teleport you to the next or the previous town in the chain, for 400g.  The
chain doesn't follow a particular geographic pattern, but it's not random;
teleporting forward from Fingle will always get you to Binu.
    New dungeon stuff.
        Dungeons have several more wall textures now.
        Dungeons cannot be changed so that some parts of the dungeon are
completely blocked off.  This means we had to wipe
the dungeon database, and start from scratch on dungeons.  This won't effect
the player database, except for who was mistress of what dungeon.
        The dungeon mistress can change camera angles now, to better see the
layout of the dungeon.
        Wandering monsters are more actively wandering.
    Now you can click on another player and give them your money.  Yay!

To help the mistress protect her treasure chests, static monsters are now
sticky.  That is, players who move into their square can't move away until
the monster is destroyed.  There is a particle effect to the square to show
that effect exists.

Town mages exist to do whatever you want.  If you've got any ideas, please post them.

I've also fixed a bug which caused the world to improperly update when
coming out of dungeons.

I think the biggest thing players might have a problem with is the wipe of
I didn't mean to upset anybody by wiping dungeons.  It's critical, or we wouldn't
do it.


9/02/02
Several small bug fixes, a new background for the frontend (courtesy of Marion),
small text changes.

8/29/02
Changes:
	New /commands:
		/tell or t - sends a message to one avatar
			eg. /tell Super Thomasina You go, Girl!
		/who - lists all players online on the map or dungeon you are currently in.
		/whoall - lists all online players
		/where - tells you the location of an online player
			eg. /where Sogetsu
		/teleport - FOR ADMINS ONLY, teleports the player instantly to the given coordinates.
		works inside dungeons, too.
			eg. /teleport 20 23

	New keyboard shortcuts:
		I, W, and S toggle the inventory, workbench, and skill windows, just like clicking the
			buttons.
		The Insert, Home, and Page Up keys work the same way.
		ESC clears the screen of any open inventory-type window.
		the / key now acts like pressing ENTER, but automatically prepends a / character.
		the ' key acts like pressing the ENTER key.
		the ; key acts like pressing the ENTER key, but automatically prepends /emote

	Also, the "say nothing" bug is fixed.

	In non-keyboard-related news, I fixed a big issue which kept you from seeing the sword the other
	players have in their hands.  There was also an issue with the proper sword color not
	being sent; that's fixed, too.

8/27/02
Seems like the server has become MUCH more stable; The current version has been
running for exactly 24 hours.

Changes:
	Fixed another client memory leak.
	Changed some code which may have given older vid cards a problem.  We'll see.
	Changed the /commands:
		/a or /announce  ----  sends to everyone in the game
		/s or /shout ---- sends to everyone in sight
		/e or /emote ---- does a standard text emote


8/26/02
NOW, we're open BETA! :)

Just a few changes to fix memory leaks and try to keep the server
from crashing.


8/25/02
Okay, didn't go public BETA before, but maybe this time. :)
Changes:
	Dead avatars now respawn in the last town they entered.
	When you enter the game with an avatar, the avatar starts exactly where she
	left the game, not at the re-spawn point.
	Changed network code, hopefully the server will be more stable.
	Added two pages of EULA screens at the beginning.  Hopefully won't turn anybody off.
	Added option modes and sub-modes, for instructions and credits.
	Added console slash commands, implemented /shout and /announce.
	Added compass/location bar in upper-left.
	Framerate indicator is now toggled with the 'f' key.  Framerate max was bumped up to 40.
	Changed and upgraded a lot of draw stuff:
		Culled items out of viewing frustrum.  Should get a framerate bump from that.
		Added all the trees and the extra house Andrei gave me (finally).
		Changed the positioning of static objects (trees, rocks, and houses).
		Fixed the way static objects were being created and destroyed, along with their
			FlockPoints.
		Added replacement clothing from Marion.
	Added text-wrap.

8/18/02
This is the version we're going to go public BETA with, unless we find some
serious issue!

Changes:
	New spiders, courtesy of Marion.

	Minor bug fixes.


7/26/02
Changes:
	Halved the animation rate of the avatar's run cycle.  A bit better...

	Threw away the DXPointSprite implementation of particles, substituting a more
	traditional tri-list.  Hopefully people will have a better time with the particles
	now.

	Added the original bottom and top to the list of available clothing for a new
	avatar.

	Changed the keyboard handling; should be better and smoother now, PLUS you can finally
	tab to the next edit box!


7/14/02
Changes:
	Major re-write of the DirectX8 graphics initialization code.  Okay, a major
	*stealing* of Microsoft's code for initing the graphics.  Hopefully THIS time
	will be the magic bullet that lets more people run the game successfully.

	Put code in to slow down the avatar as she gets closer to her target point.
	This changes the feel of movement; let me know how you feel about it.

	Several logic bugs have been fixed.  The affect of Strength totems was in the
	game, but was being incorrectly reported.  That's fixed.  Also, the level
	advancement for Dodge had been broken.  Now fixed.  Thanks for the bug reports,
	Frank.

7/9/02
Changes:
	Dungeons now seek out mistresses.  The only time a player can edit a dungeon is
	when the dungeon chooses them to be the dungeon's mistress.  This term is for
	4 real-time days, currently.  A player cannot be mistress to more than one dungeon
	at once.

	Ground shadows are in.  Let me know what you think.  If you don't see ground
	shadows when you first play the game, go into a dungeon and see if you can
	see them there.  Let me know!

	Banshee, Hunting Spider, and Demon Spider (ooh, scary!!) are now in, courtesy
	of Marion.

	Modification to how I use the DrawPrimitive() command should fix problems for
	some people who can't see the particles correctly, or who have other drawing
	issues.  Let me know if it fixes or doesn't fix the problem.

	Major upgrade to the looks of the UI.  What do you think?

	Replaced that sandy monolith with a rock outcropping, and replaced the towers
	with cave entrances, courtesy of Andrei.

	Change to how I get the stencil buffer format.  It POSSIBLY could help people
	who can't play the game at all.


7/4/02
Boy, do we have a bunch of changes!
	Monsters now live in dungeons.
	There are about 40 dungeons, in 5 ranks, which determines how big they are, and
		what sort of monsters live in them.
	The data has all been compressed; the old game was pushing 22 Megs.  Now the whole game
		is about 7 megs.
	New spider monster.
	I created a super-long timer system, and integrated it into the totem system, so the
		totem life is tracked properly, even if the server is reset or offline.
	The avatar now has a different and more powerful customization screen.  Now you can
		change your avatar's face, top, and bottom, plus you can color the hair, top,
		and bottom, independently.  Old avatars default to a tolerable state, hopefully.
	Monsters do more damage now, a random amount between 1.0 and 2.0 times their base damage.


	Major user interface changes:
		Now you click DOWN on a list item, or a mob, and a menu will appear under your mouse.
		Move to the menu option you want and release the left mouse button.
		You can only check the ground's inventory by clicking on your current square.
		You can move by clicking on an adjacent square.
		You can turn the camera by holding down the RIGHT mouse button, and moving the mouse
		right and left.
		The buttons are all a bit prettier.
		The chat window has been moved to the bottom of the screen.  The drag bar now stretches
		the window up.
		The information text window is gone; now all game text appears in the chat window,
		and is color-coded yellow.
		Lighting has been changed in the setup screens.
		The rosette is gone, but may be replaced.  Anyway, you can no longer click on a button
		to turn or move.  You now click on hte ground you want to move to, and RIGHT click
		to turn the camera.
		The health bars of the avatar and monster now appear over the names of these mobs.
		Fixed mob names so they aren't obscured by other objects now.
		The mouse is sped up in higher resolutions, but it may need further tweeking.

6/20/02
Changes:
	Added dungeons!
	And they're player-editable!
	Go to a tower, move into it, and you'll be in a dungeon.  Exit the dungeon
	by moving to 0,0.  When in the dungeon, three new buttons appear in the lower-left
	part of the screen.  Use these buttons to customize the dungeon!  Yay!

6/9/02
Changes:
	New monster: ghost
	new avatar run animation
	Magic system is in!!  Now you can buy totem, imbue them with 8 different magics,
	and create magical totems that effect your game.
	New Merchant and trainer art
	Changed fog to be light blue; wadda ya think now?
	Fixed crash bug with particle system

6/3/02
Changes:
	Better text formatting
	Distance fog; wadda ya think?
	Added magic skills to trainer, but they don't do anything yet
	Added particle effects to trainers and monster death
	Bug fixes

5/29/02
Major changes:
	added 4 new monster base types
	Basic sword crafting is now in
	Fixed direction rosette to be correct
	Now just holding down the up arrow lets you continue to move from square-to-square
	Fixed lighting for player and monsters, looks much better

4/24/02
Changed the UI, mostly adding four buttons to bring up the four inventories; 
Items, Component Items, Skills, and Spell Effects.
Added towers, which you can't move into.  You also can't move into the water any more.
Added teachers, green versions of merchants, where you can learn skills.  Currently the
skills don't mean anything, tho.

3/20/02
Added 2 tigers and 6 golems (and 2 more minotaurs) to the monster mix.  Changed the
UI in several small ways.  The biggest is camera control, which is no longer locked
to the four cardinal directions.

Also got Alt-tabbing to (almost) work.  It works, but coming back from an alt-tab still
messes up some draw settings.  It works, though, and I'll get the draw settings
straight soon.

3/10/02
Changed front end quite a bit graphically, including a new higher-poly avatar animation.
Changed the standin monster to a fully animated minotaur, 4 types!
Upon death, monsters flash for 1/3 second.  Needs adjusting or replacing.
Fixed some bugs.


2/23/02
Welcome to Blade Mistress!  This is the first version of this readme.txt file.
This game is far from complete, but should let you adventure in
the world of Blade Mistress.

Blade Mistress is a server-centric, ultra-low bandwidth, persistant world,
massively multiplayer, 3D graphical fantasy role-playing game.
In other words, it's a game where you bash monsters and take
thier stuff.  Not amazingly original, but wait!  Blade Mistress does or
will incorporate some cool new ideas, like:

No more genders, everyone is a Barbarian Babe!

No more spawn points, monsters come into the world at random
places, and move around to self-order themselves.

Customizable weapons!  Craft your own sword, by actually adjusting
each vertex, and see that weapon as you designed it in the hand of
your avatar.

Customizable dungeons! Players dig out and create their own
underground spaces, and populate them with monsters (dungeons),
or decorate them nicely (housing).

Complex crafting!

Complex magic systems, centered around potions and wands.

No PvP. Griefers not welcome!

What does ultra-low bandwidth mean?  It means that bandwidth
costs big bucks, so the only way to bring this game to you is
to design the game from the ground up with a commitment to using
as little network bandwidth as possible.  The result is a game
map that is divided into large squares, and you move from
square to square, instead of just going anywhere you want.
